## User Experince (UX)

### User Stories
 * ### First Time Visitor Goals
    * As a first time visitor i want to be able to easily identify the purpose of the site and the service the company provide.
    * I want to be able to easily navigate to more information and/or social links to judge how trustworthy the bussiness is
    * I would like to be able to see feedback from previous customers to see if the service is relevant to my needs and if those needs have been met by others before me.

* ### Returning Visitor Goals
    * Returning to the site I would like to be able to find more information on the product I have purchased/planning to purchase.
    * I would like to be able to find contact information for the company to provide feedback or report any issues/concerns I may have.
    
* ### Frequent Visitor Goals
    * Frequent visitation shouldn't be an issue. Once subscribed the customer should not have to revisit frequently to enjoy their product. However this could be addressed as the company grows by adding in more and more content like painting tutorials, blogs, FAQs and such. Possibly a community page and forums for peer to peer critiques etc.
    * The goal of a frquent visitor would ideally be for word of mouth promotion, showing freinds and family how easy it is to use for a top notch product.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

* Used ColorSpace to generate a classy palette around a deep blue I wanted to use as a filter for the hero image. Think uses greys and pinks to make the rest of the site pop.

### Typography

* I have chosen Cormorant SC and Proza Libre for the font families because the gothic feel of Cormorant fits the dystopian nature of the sci-fi and fantasy universes featured in the products rich lore and Proza compliments this nicely for the body text.

### Imagery

*  My hero image will be there to engage the customer and show what can be possible with what they are paying for. There will also be a gallery of previous customers' minis from beginner and veteran painters.
